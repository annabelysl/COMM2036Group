              <h1> What are the effects of Fake News on Society?  </h1>
              <p> The impact of fake news on social media and online outlets far outweighs the impact on traditional print and broadcast outlets. When people learned about fake news on social media, 58% had less trust in those stories as opposed to 24% in mainstream media.
                The spread of fake news is often facilitated by fake news websites, which, in order to gain credibility, specialize in creating attention-grabbing news that often imitates well-known news sources. According to Jestin Coler, who said he does it for "fun", he earns about $10,000 a month from advertising on his fake news websites.
