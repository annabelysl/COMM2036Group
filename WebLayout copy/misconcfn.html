              <h1> Common misconceptions about Fake News </h1>
              <p> In recent days, the society has  become accustomed to the term "fake news", particularly in relation to elections. However, It has always been there. Since many centuries ago, fake news has been serving as a tool to conceal and only transmit specific information. In fact, spreading forged news has gotten a lot simpler and effective owing to the enormous growth of social media.

                Media sources that are part of the traditional mainstream are required to abide by journalistic ethics norms. This covers authenticity, source review, and accuracy. Editors, newsrooms, and authors are all publicly identified. Additionally, there are legal procedures in place to keep them responsible and oversee their performance.
                
                The Internet, however, makes it simple for anybody to generate information, show it whatever they choose, and share it without abiding to the same ethical norms.This makes it simple to be duped, especially given the information saturation we encounter online.
