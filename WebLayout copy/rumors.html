              <h1> What are rumors? </h1>
              <p>  <b> Main Definition </b> <br> Rumours are uncertain information or story that have been circulating between people or false news that is passed from person to person. It might exist everywhere around people in our life such as in schools, family, and workplace. Furthermore, it can now occur on social media since social media is the communication channel that we use the most nowadays.
                <br> <br> <p> </p> <div class="zoom"> <p> <h3> Research on Rumors </h3> <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268202709_The_science_of_rumors" target="_blank"> The Science of Rumors </a> <br> "This study takes a soft scientific cut to talks about rumors, hoaxes and urban legends. Social psychology, more elegantly, uses the latin word rumor (rumour in British English), which means sound, voice, or gossip. In social, economical, political, cultural and scientific communication, rumors indicate news that is presumed true, that circulates without being confirmed or made evident. The scientific history of rumors is briefly described starting from the period of ancient Rome, throughout the Second World War and the Internet era, up to today. We will try to answer some questions that can be useful to scientists today. What are rumors? How are they born? How do they spread? By which laws are they regulated? How do we need to fight them? A final question regards the collocation of rumors into modern science. Science today is divided into 'hard' and 'soft' science (the latter of which generally lacks a basic mathematical structure); these terms, respectively, indicate the natural sciences, which investigate Nature, and the social/human sciences, which investigate man in all his facets. Maybe rumors can be thought of as a bridge suspended between two banks: those of 'scientific truth' and 'human truth'." </p></div></b> <br> <p> </p><p> </p>
