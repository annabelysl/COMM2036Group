              <h1> What is Misinformation? </h1>
              <p> Misinformation is incorrect or misleading information.[1] It differs from disinformation, which is deliberately deceptive. Rumours are information not attributed to any particular source,[5] and so are unreliable and often unverified, but can turn out to be either true or false. 
                Advances in technology has impacted the way we communicate information and the way misinformation is spread.
                Misinformation has impacts on our societies' ability to receive information which then influences our communities, politics, and medical field.[7]
                <br> <br> <p> </p> <div class="zoom"> <p> <h3> Research on Misinformation </h3> <a href="https://cssn.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Misinformation-and-how-to-correct-it-John-Cook.pdf" target="_blank"> Misinformation and How to Correct It </a> <br> "The increasing prevalence of misinformation in society may adversely affect
                    democratic decision making, which depends on a well-informed public. False information can originate from a number of sources including rumors, literary fiction,
                    mainstream media, corporate-vested interests, governments, and nongovernmental
                    organizations. The rise of the Internet and user-driven content has provided a venue
                    for quick and broad dissemination of information, not all of which is accurate. Consequently, a large body of research spanning a number of disciplines has sought to
                    understand misinformation and determine which interventions are most effective in
                    reducing its influence. This essay summarizes research into misinformation, bringing
                    together studies from psychology, political science, education, and computer science.
                    Cognitive psychology investigates why individuals struggle with correcting
                    misinformation and inaccurate beliefs, and why myths are so difficult to dislodge.
                    Two important findings involve (i) various “backfire effects,” which arise when
                    refutations ironically reinforce misconceptions, and (ii) the role of worldviews
                    in accentuating the persistence of misinformation. Computer scientists simulate
                    the spread of misinformation through social networks and develop algorithms
                    to automatically detect or neutralize myths. We draw together various research
                    threads to provide guidelines on how to effectively refute misconceptions without
                    risking backfire effects." </p></div></b> <br> <p> </p><p> </p>
