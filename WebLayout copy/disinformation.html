              <h1> What is Disinformation?  </h1>
              <p> Disinformation is defined as false, incorrect, or misleading information that is actively prepared, provided, and promoted in order to inflict public harm or profit. With the emergence of social media, misinformation has travelled quickly. Over 40% of individuals polled in various parts of the world are concerned that it has exacerbated divisiveness and foreign involvement in politics. Disinformation may perplex and deceive populations, sow doubt in international norms, institutions, and democratically agreed-upon policies, disrupt elections, and feed scepticism about critical issues such as climate change. The more this phenomena spread internationally and gets more multifaceted, the more important it is to confront not only the content component of misinformation but also the manipulative influence methods that accompany it. It is also critical to understand the reasons for misinformation, whether political, financial, or reputational (to gain influence), in order to counter them.

                    It is argued that, in order to deal with this problem, we first need
                    to understand exactly what disinformation is. The philosophical
                    method of conceptual analysis is described, and a conceptual
                    analysis of disinformation is offered. Finally, how this analysis
                    can help us to deal with the problem of disinformation is briefly
                    discussed" </p></div></b> <br> <p> </p><p> </p>
